Regarding Things is kind of a blog and a Youtube channel that will give you the secrets of life which are totally useless.  I cannot tell you how to apply them to your life though. [Remember, I can only show you the door. You are the one that has to walk through it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc3VG9JZM6I)

There are a few things in my mind about this website. 

### find people who love their jobs
First of them is asking people who are passionate about what they do, about how they found their passion. I plan to throw them a few simple questions and ask them to answer.  I am eager to do this because I believe it will help me and you to find your passion as well. So I hope we get the most out of the series together.

### find people who are productive
I cannot say I am a productivity master, but my plan is to be somehow productive to get things done. For that, I started reading articles and books about productivity and I will try to share here as much as possible.

### last but not least
I will share about the things I am interested in. You will see some posts *regarding* movies, TV series, technology news etc. The idea is to make them last for years. Not to comment on temporary events so much. I don’t want people to read my posts after years and they don’t understand anything. 

Let’s see if we can manage. I hope you enjoy your time on Regarding Things. Purpose of the website might change over the time but this is the idea for now.
